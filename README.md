exo-watch is an interactive web workbench for exoplanet classification, built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025. This tool allows you to train, compare, and fine-tune state-of-the-art machine learning models in real-time, using the official Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) dataset.

## üöÄ Core Features

- Model Workbench: Don't settle for a single approach. Directly train and compare the performance of LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest on the same dataset.

- Interactive Hyperparameter Tuning: Modify key model parameters (like learning_rate, n_estimators, max_depth) and instantly observe how they impact accuracy and performance.

- "What-If" Candidate Analysis: Manually input the features of a planetary candidate‚Äîreal or hypothetical‚Äîand receive an instant classification from each of the trained models.

- Feature Insight: Analyze which planetary and stellar features (such as koi_depth, koi_impact, koi_srad) are the most decisive for each model through dynamic feature importance charts.

## üéØ Who is exo-watch for?

- exo-watch is designed for technical users who want to explore the intersection of astronomy and artificial intelligence.

- Data Scientists & AI Enthusiasts: Experiment with model architectures and tune hyperparameters on a fascinating and complex real-world problem.

- Researchers & Astronomy Students: Gain a deeper intuition for which physical parameters are most predictive in distinguishing real planets from false positives.

- Advanced Educators: Use the tool to provide hands-on instruction in the concepts of training, evaluating, and comparing applied machine learning models.
